description: Show CaBrain connection status — endpoint + which brains you can reach.
---

Report the CaBrain connection.

Run `cabrain auth whoami` via Bash to show the configured endpoint, token, and reachable brains. If the `cabrain` CLI isn't found, tell the user to install it (`npm i -g cabrain-cli`) and run `/cabrain:doctor`.

Then call the **brain_list** MCP tool and confirm the same brains resolve through the live MCP connection — that verifies the token in the plugin config is valid, not just the CLI's saved config.
